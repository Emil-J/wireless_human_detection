# Short Explanation Of The Project
The practical aim of this project was to familiarize myeself with the functionalities of the CMSIS 
RTOS v2 interface in the STM32Cube integrated development environment, while also 
exploring the CC1101 module, which functions as a transceiver communication module 
operating on the radio frequency of 433 MHz.
